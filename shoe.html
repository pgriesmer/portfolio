			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<p>As part of my UI/UX course at Brown this fall, I worked with Ragna Agerup and Megs Malpali to design an interface for a startup launched at Y Combinator this year, Fixers. Our assignment required us to create an interface based solely on <a class="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/21/all-59-startups-that-launched-today-at-y-combinators-s18-demo-day-2/" target="_blank">TechCrunch's summary of the company</a>: 

				<p class="black-paragraph">"Travel and experience marketplace Fixers pitches experiences ranging from yoga retreasts to trail-running weekends and music festivals that are curated by locals in the know. It's designed to help travelers discover and book trips they couldn't find anywhere else."</p>

			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<h2 class="project-paragraph-step">1 // Lo-Fi Mockups</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<p>We quickly put together several lo-fi mockups to think through different ideas about how we might design our interface. Among the ideas we considered were location-based search, activity-based search, and a personality quiz that produced recommendations for users based on their interests.</p>

				<h2 class="project-paragraph-step">2 // Hi-Fi Prototypes</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<p>We ultimately decided that a location-based search (with some modifications) would be the most intuitive design for users and began building a <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.figma.com/file/gdNw2PeWO5XvNBTNF91OmxCC/Iterative-Design%3A-Fixers?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">hi-fi prototype</a> for our idea.</p>
				<p>After choosing the font and color scheme, I designed the header component for each of the pages on our site.</p>

				<img src="fixershi1.png">
				<img src="fixershi2.png">
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<p>As seen above, we liked the idea of using the search parameters from our home screen as filters on the search results page. We thought users would want to be able to filter by date, price, type of activity (which we called a "theme"), and location.</p>

			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<p>In our estimation, one of the advantages of the Fixers platform over rival platforms (like <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/experiences?refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fexperiences" target="_blank">AirBnB's Experiences section</a>) would be the ability to add (1) free activities and (2) activities without any particular date or time associated to them to a user's itinerary (which also served as a user's shopping cart).</p>
				<p class="black-paragraph">I had the idea that experiences in a user's itinerary could be ordered by date but that experiences without a particular date or time associated with them could be draggable elements into which users could write in a date and time if they so wished.</p>

				<h2 class="project-paragraph-step">3 // Eyetracking</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<p>We used eyetracking software to test out whether users would navigate our interface in the way that we expected. We were most interested in the order in which they would review information on the Itinerary page, and we found some support for a hypothesis we devised about the same.</p>
				<p class="black-paragraph">We expected users to first look at the page header, then at the product photos, then dates,  product names, costs, edit links and delete icons, total, and "Checkout" button before clicking the same. Our subject's actual eye movements are shown below:</p>

				<h2 class="project-paragraph-step">Outcomes</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<p>We presented our hi-fi designs to several of our classmates and received a fair amount of positive feedback about our UI. That said, if I had more time, I would reposition the calendar and reviews on the product page to make the layout a little cleaner. I might also change the Itinerary page header to conform more closely to the other page headers on our site.</p>
				<p>This project was my first major exposure to Figma and first-ever exposure to eyetracking. I particularly enjoyed writing the JavaScript code needed to recreate the order in which our test user looked at the different elements on Itinerary page.</p>
